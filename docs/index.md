Tenes Emapandas Graciela is a clone of 'Plan Táctico y Estratégico
de la Guerra', which is a pseudo-clone of Risk, a multiplayer turn-based
strategy game. Some rules are different.

Have a lot of fun :)

# Brief history of TEG

Sebastián Cativa Tolosa, once told me to do this game.
I think that was in 1996, in a chat we were having in the University. Well, we started to think the game. But I don't know why, the project died after 3 or 4 months. In 1998, the project was reactivated, but after 2 weeks it died again :(. Finally, in February 2000, I started the game again, and it seems that it is not dead :-).

I associate the board game on which TEG is based with many happy hours and days that I spent in the yard with friends when I was younger. At some point, when I was older, I came across TEG. I wrote to riq and told him that I liked the game but found the graphics really ugly. Ricardo said "If you can do it better, do it". I didn't think I was particularly talented, but I promptly replied with something like "I can, I'll do it" ;-). Since then, I've tried to make the game appealing. I don't remember exactly when, but it must have been a few decades ago when riq finally entrusted me with the project. Despite my very modest programming knowledge, Ricardo seemed to have great faith that I wouldn't give up... thx a lot.

__Many thanks to everyone who continues to contributing to the game.__
